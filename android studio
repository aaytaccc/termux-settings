Android Studio

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================

  1. Unpack the Android Studio distribution archive that you downloaded
  2.      where you wish to install the program. We will refer to this
  3.      location as your {installation home}.
  2. To start the application, open a console, cd into "{installation home}/bin" and type:
       ./studio.sh
     This will initialize various configuration files in the configuration directory:
          ~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio2020.3.
  3. [OPTIONAL] Add "{installation home}/bin" to your PATH environment
  4.      variable so that you can start Android Studio from any directory.
  4. [OPTIONAL] To adjust the value of the JVM heap size, create a file studio.vmoptions
  5.      (or studio64.vmoptions if using a 64-bit JDK) in the configuration directory
  6.      and set the -Xms and -Xmx parameters. To see how to do this,
  7.      you can reference the vmoptions file under "{installation home}/bin" as a model
  8.      but do not modify it, add your options to the new file.
  [OPTIONAL] Change the location of the "config" and "system" directories
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By default, Android Studio stores all your settings in the
    ~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio2020.3 directory
      and uses ~/.local/share/Google/AndroidStudio2020.3 as a data cache.
        To change the location of these directories:
  1. Open a console and cd into ~/.config/Google/AndroidStudio2020.3
  2. Create a file idea.properties and set the idea.system.path and idea.config.path variables, for example:
     idea.system.path=~/custom/system
          idea.config.path=~/custom/config
  NOTE: Store the data cache ("system" directory) on a disk with at least 1 GB of free space.

Enjoy!
